NetworkRootApi: API keys and making requests
================================================


USAGE OF THIS API MAY CAUSE SECURITY RISKS  
READ AND *UNDERSTAND* the [Network ROOT API documentation](6100-NetworkRootApi.ms) before compromising your systems.


SDKs
-----------

We can provide you base code for C#. If you write a SDK for our API, we would be glad to add a link in this list for others to use.

* C# API client is coming...


API keys
--------------

API keys are managed by-network. Open the main website of any network with an admin account. Navigate to /Dashboard/ApiKeys. Create a key.

You should create as many keys as necessary. Imagine a key is compromised, you want to disable it and create a new one. You will then replace the old key by the new one is some applications. It's best if few applications have to be changed.

DO NOT EVER SAVE THE SECRET KEY IN CLIENT APPLICATIONS.  
IT WOULD COMPROMISE THE SECRET KEY AND ANYONE WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE ADMINISTRATIVE CALLS.  
AS A REMINDER, THIS API IS DESIGNED FOR SERVER-TO-SERVER CALLS WHERE THE SECRET KEY CAN BE KEPT SECRET. 


Make API calls
-------------------------

Here are the basic elements of the request.

    HTTP method HTTP query HTTP/1.1                                    // standard http line
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-NetworkName:       network name               // REQUIRED if NetworkDomainName is not set
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-NetworkDomainName: network domain name        // REQUIRED if NetworkName is not set
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-Key: API Key (AK)                             // REQUIRED
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-Identity: Identity Key (IK)                   // optional: authenticated calls
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-Time: Time (format: yyyyMMdd'T'HHmmssffff'Z') // REQUIRED
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-Hash: Hash                                    // REQUIRED message signature
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-ClientRequestId: ClientRequestId              // optional: logging correlation id
    Accept: desired response content-type                              // REQUIRED
    Accept-Language: culture                                           // optional
    Content-Type: application/json                                     // only when posting contents
    
    HTTP content


### Signing requests

You need to get an API key and the associated secret key.

To sign requests, you have to build a string from a few variables, hash it using SHA256 and send the hash in a header.

You should have received the following variables: *Application Key (AK)*, *Application Secret (AS)*,

When making user-authenticated calls, you will also have: *Identity Key (IK, aka user access token)*, *Identity Secret (IS)*. This API does not support it.

You must not reveal any secret value (*AS*, *IS*). If you are building a client app, ensure you hide the secret values as well as you can.

The Time variable is the current **UTC time** with the format `yyyyMMdd'T'HHmmssffff'Z'`. Exemple: 20160519T0633381785Z. If your device is not able to get the right time, you can call `/api/Util/Time` to get the server time.

Here is how you build the string (UTF 8) to be hashed (pre-hash) for the *Hash* variable.

    pre-hash = Application Key (AK) + "\n"
             + Application Secret (AS) + "\n"
             + Identity Key (IK) + "\n"      // might be empty
             + Identity Secret (IS) + "\n"   // might be empty
             + UPPER(HTTP method) + "\n"
             + HTTP query + "\n"
             + HTTP content + "\n"           // might be empty
             + Time

Using SHA256, you can hash the `pre-hash` and use the HEX representation. Prefix the `hash` string value with the current protocol hint `$1$`.

    Hash = "$1$" + BytesToHex( SHA256( UTF8_StringToBytes( pre-hash ) ) )


### Request object & content types

POST methods often requires you to send a formatted message. You need to specify the message format using the `Content-Type` header. Supported values are `application/json`. You should not specify this header when you are not posting content.

    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

The default output format is JSON. You should always specify the desired output format using the `Accept` header.

    Accept: application/json


### Example

Here is an example for the api/Util/Ping method. Here are all our base variables.

    API Key (AK)         = "ak_123456789"
    API Secret (AS)      = "as_456789123"
    Identity Key (CK)    = "ik_852741963"
    Identity Secret (CS) = "is_789456132"
    HTTP method          = "GET"
    HTTP query           = "/api/Util/Ping"
    HTTP content         =  empty
    Time                 = "20150201T1444230000Z"

Let's compute the pre-hash and Hash. You may try this precise example to verify you do the hash right.

    pre-hash = "ak_123456789" + "\n"
             + "as_456789123" + "\n"
             + "ik_852741963" + "\n"
             + "is_789456132" + "\n"
             + "GET" + "\n"
             + "/api/Util/Ping" + "\n"
             + "" + "\n"                // note the empty string. A GET request does not have a body.
             + "20150201T1444230000Z"   // make sure your machine has a valid time.

    Hash = "$1$" + BytesToHex( SHA256( UTF8_StringToBytes( pre-hash ) ) )
    // $1$C1BE79D18F0E8CC8299925D17377B68E736C6AF0B9EC73C11AC47DE06F799132
    

Finally, here is the HTTP query

    GET /api/Util/Ping HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-NetworkName: network name
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-Key: ak_123456789   
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-Identity: ik_852741963
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-Time: 20150201T1444230000Z
    X-SparkleNetworksApi-Hash: $1$C1BE79D18F0E8CC8299925D17377B68E736C6AF0B9EC73C11AC47DE06F799132

General notes
---------------------

### Dates

Dates must be given in the ISO 8601 format. Preferably in the UTC (Z) time zone.

    C#:     DateTime value = DateTime.ParseExact("2016-10-04T12:23:34.1546Z", "o", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, DateTimeStyles.RoundtripKind);
    C#:     https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/az4se3k1(v=vs.110).aspx#Roundtrip
    PHP:    $d = new DateTime('2011-01-01T15:03:01.012345Z');
    PHP:    http://php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php
    Note:   https://xkcd.com/1179/

### Endpoint paths

An endpoint is based on the following templates: 

* `/NetworkRootApi/{Service class}/{Action}`
* `/NetworkRootApi/{Service class}/{Action}/{id}`
* `/NetworkRootApi/{Service class}/{Action}?[Param1=Value]+`

Service class is a name that designated the kind of object you want to target. Some names: `Companies`, `CompanyCategories`, `Users`, `InformationNotes`, `Groups`, `TagCategories`, `TagDefinitions`... 

There is always an action name after the service class name. Here are some repeatable patterns.

* `GET /NetworkRootApi/{Service class}/ById/{id}` Fetch an item using its ID.
* `GET /NetworkRootApi/{Service class}/All` Returns all the items, reserved for small tables.
* `GET /NetworkRootApi/{Service class}/List?Offset=0&Count=100&KnownFilter=All` Returns a paginated list of items.
    * `Offset` is the pagination offset. Default is zero, increment using the Count parameter.
    * `Count` is the pagination size. The default size is optimized on a per-service basis. Avoid asking too many at a time.
    * `KnownFilter` is the name of a popular filter that can be used.
* `GET /NetworkRootApi/{Service class}/PrepareEdit` Returns the form data to create an item.
* `GET /NetworkRootApi/{Service class}/PrepareEdit/{id}` Returns the form data to edit an item.
* `POST /NetworkRootApi/{Service class}/Edit` Create or edit an item. See the Request-Result pattern.

### Request-Result pattern

Endpoints that allow changes in the database follow the Request-Result pattern.

There is usually a `Prepare` method to get the editable form. When editing an object, you receive the editable parts. When a precompletion list is required in the form, you receive the available values.

The actual method needs a request object as a body and a result object is returned within the usual response wrapper.

A typical request:

    {
      "Id": null,
      "Name": "New information note!",
      "Description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ... lectus nam.",
      "ActingUserId": 6
    }

Note the `ActingUserId` that is often required for traceability.

Typical results:

    {
      "Data": {
        "Item": {
          "Id": 5,
          "Name": "New information note!",
          "Description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ... lectus nam.",
          "NetworkId": 1,
          "UserId": 6,
          "IsDeleted": false
        },
        "Succeed": true,
        "Errors": []
      }
    }

    {
      "Data": {
        "Succeed": false,
        "Errors": [
          {
            "Code": "NoSuchActingUser",
            "DisplayMessage": "The acting user is not defined. Are you authenticated?",
            "Detail": "The user id 1045 does not match any user."
          }
        ],
        "Request": { }
      }
    }


### Errors

Validation errors (HTTP 404) are returned when the fields of a form do not pass validation. You can detect this kind of error with the property `ErrorCode = "InvalidMessage"`.  The `ModelState` property contains the validation errors.

    {
      "Data": null,
      "ErrorCode": "InvalidMessage",
      "ModelState": {
        "Description": [
          "This must contain less than 4000 characters"
        ]
      },
      "ErrorHelp": "Validation errors occured, check the ModelState property. "
    }

Domain errors (HTTP 400) are returned when the action cannot be performed because of a failing domain rule. The object in that `Data` property is a base domain result. The `Succeed` boolean allows you a quick check for success. The `Errors` collection will help you display error messages to the user. Note that the original `Request` object is given back.

    {
      "Data": {
        "Succeed": false,
        "Errors": [
          {
            "Code": "NoSuchActingUser",
            "DisplayMessage": "The acting user is not defined. Are you authenticated?",
            "Detail": "The user id 1045 does not match any user."
          }
        ],
        "Request": { }
      }
    }

Internal server errors (HTTP 500) look like that. The `Message` can be displayed to the user. The `ExceptionMessage`, `ExceptionType` and `StackTrace` properties are for developers.

    {
      "Message": "An error has occurred.",
      "ExceptionMessage": "Could not load file or assembly 'System.Web.Http.WebHost, Version=5.2.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)",
      "ExceptionType": "System.IO.FileLoadException",
      "StackTrace": "   at Sparkle.WebBase.WebApi.GlobalApiExceptionFilterAttribute.OnException(HttpActionExecutedContext context)\r\n   at System.Web.Http.Filters.ExceptionFilterAttribute.OnExceptionAsync(HttpActionExecutedContext actionExecutedContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken) .........."
    }
