Hints
=================

What is it for?
-----------------

The first usage of hints is to show the user tiny help messages in the main UI.

Hints are declared in code and in database. Hints have a relation to users.

The second usage is to store a last seen date of items in a collection. For example with [Ads](Feature-Ads.md), we can display something to indicate unread ads based on the last ad update date store in the relation between a specific hint and the user.

Known hints
-----------------

The feature is not limited to predefined hints. Predefined hints can be found in the KnownHints class.
