Installation Planning
=========================

What size?
----------------

There are a few numbers you have to think about. These will help you find appropriate servers.

### How many companies?

One main feature in Sparkle Networks is the Companies. When a user registers, he has to be in a company. You can also disable the Companies feature; in this case all users go in the same invisible company.

It's OK to run a thousand companies. Running more has not been tested.


### How many users?

Users is one of the most database-intensive factor. Running 10K users is OK. Running more has not been tested.

### How may publications?

Users can post publications. There is no known system limitations.
