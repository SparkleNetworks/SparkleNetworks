NetworkRootApi
=====================================


The Network*Root* API is an administrative API for Sparkle Networks.


BE VERY CAREFUL!
----------------------

### This API is for **server-to-server** calls

DO NOT use this API for client-to-server uses, this would compromise the API key and secret key, giving ADMINISTRATIVE access to any clever technician.

This API will NEVER support CORS because this API is NOT for client-to-server uses.

### This API does NOT support user authentication

By using this API, your are making SYSTEM CALLS, not USER CALLS.
