The homepage
=====================

The main timeline
--------------------------

It uses most of the page space. It contains: 

- all publications on the network by persons and companies
- all publications in the [groups](../Features/Groups.en.md) you are a member of
- all publications in the *team timeline* of your  [company](../Features/Companies.en.md)
- all publications in the [events](../Features/Events.en.md) you joined

In short, everything publicly published appears here plus the items that concern you.

See also: [timelines](../Features/Timelines.en.md). 

The secondary pane of the page
--------------------------

Depending on your device, you may or may not see this pane. Small screens can only see the main pane because of space requirements.

The secondary pane highlights new elements available to you and are described below.

Contact requests
--------------------------

If you have pending [contact requests](../Features/UserContacts.en.md), they appear in the secondary pane of the page. A limited number of items is displayed. You can accept or refuse requests. 

Upcoming events
--------------------------

If this feature is not enabled on your network, you will not see the *upcoming events*.

If  [events](../Features/Events.en.md) have been created and their date is to come, then you will see a limited number of events in the secondary pane of the page. A few participants are highlighted.

Incoming profiles
--------------------------

If this feature is not enabled on your network, you will not see the *incoming profiles*.

Whenever new profiles are published and validated by the *network administrators*, they appear in the secondary pane of the page.

See also: [Incoming profiles](../Features/WorkHere.en.md). 

Newcomers
--------------------------

Newly registered [users](../Features/Users.en.md) on the network are highlighted in the secondary pane of the page.
