The network's public pages
---------------------------

Some pages can be seen by anyone. This will help you get a sense of what you will find after signing in. 

Public events
--------------------

Some [events](../Features/Events.en.md) are public. You can fill the "I wish to come" form to signal your presence at the event. **Doing that will not grant you the right to join the event.** The event may be subject to ticketing or another RSVP system. Contact the [network team](../NetworkTeam.en.md) for more information about an event.


Work here
-----------------

Some networks have a public page to publish your resume to the registered companies. 

The form will allow you to give basic contact information and links to your online profiles. 

Administrator validation occurs before the network members can see your profile.

Once your profile is validated, the company administrators will be able to see the information you sent. They may then contact you.
