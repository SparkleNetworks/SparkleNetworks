Companies
=======================

The companies list is essential for the network. Each and all users belong to a company.

A company on Sparkle Networks is the most local gathering form. Colleagues and chiefs of a real company have their place here.

Company members
------------------------------

One must choose a company when registering on the network. It is possible to create a new company when registering if the company is not yet registered in the network. Network administrators may choose to validate new users manually.  

If your email address matches the domain name of a registered company, you will automatically join this company. No administrator validation is required in this case. 

Some users become "company administrators" for various reasons. Company administrators can change the public profile of their company. They can also grant privileges to their colleagues: administrators or community manager. As a company administrator, you can also disable a user of the company. This is useful if the person actually leaves the company.

Users with the "community manager" privilege can change the profile of their company and write in the name of the company. 


The profile
------------------------------

Company administrators and company community managers are allowed to edit the company profile. 

The profile is visible to all members. It may be visible to anonymous users depending on the network configuration.

The profile helps describe the company, its activities, its members and so on. Here are some elements you can find in a company profile.

- A logo
- A name
- A category (startup, accelerator, association...)
- A baseline
- A description (free [formatable](TextFormat.en.md) text)
- A list of skills or services based on [tags](Tags.en.md)
- Contact information (phone numbers, email address, website)
- A list of locations
- Social links (Facebook, Twitter)

To change the profile, go to the company's profile. Some elements can be changed from this page. Otherwise search for the *Edit* button.

Timelines
----------------

The network contains many [timelines](Timelines.en.md) ; a company have two.

The *team* timeline is reserved to the company members. Any member of the company can see the timeline and post new things in it.

The *news* timeline is visible to the entire network and - in some cases - to anonymous users. The company *administrators* and *community managers* can post new content. The *network administrators* can also post on the behalf of the company. This timeline helps to display the company's advancements and to promote its actions. 


The company directory
----------------------

The main navigation menu displays a *companies* button that allows one to browse through the company profiles. It is possible to search for a company using a few criterias.

- whole or partial name
- skills or services
- city name


Contact a company
-------------------

When a company profile is shown to a user that is not a member of this company a *Contact* button is displayed. The user can send a message to this company. *Company administrators* are allowed to see the messages and to reply.
