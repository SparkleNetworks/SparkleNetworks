User account
============================

Registration
---------------------

Most of the time, the network is open for user registration. The website has a visible "Register" or "Apply" button to start the registration process.

By registering on the network, you accept the terms of services and all related agreements. Those are available on the website under the "Terms" link.

In order to create your [user profile](Users.en.md), you have many fields to complete. Few are required but the more you fill, the more your profile will be interesting to the other members.

The registration process may be eased using the "Connect with LinkedIn" feature. Using this feature will copy some information fields from your LinkedIn profile into your network profile.

When registering, you will need to confirm your email address by following a link that you will receive by email.

Your registration may be subject to administrator validation or refusal. Each network has its own rules about accepted members. 

Your password
---------------------

When registering, you will have to set a password. This will prevent other persons from using your user profile. Please try to use a unique password that you never used before. Prefer a *few simple words* instead of a single word or a collection of random characters; it is easier to remember it this way.

Your password is confidential, do not tell it to anyone else. If you think someone might know it, you should change it as soon as possible. The same applies to your mailbox's password: we send you email to verify your identity. Keep your mailbox's password secret. 

If you forget your password, we can send you an email with a link to reset it.

When authenticated, you can change your password by navigating to your profile, your account and "change my password".

Logging-in
---------------------

The website has a visible "Log in" button to authenticate yourself.

You will be asked for your email address and your password. You can type your *username* instead of your email address if you prefer.

If you fail at typing the correct password, you use the "Receive a log-in link by email" button. You will receive an email with a link to follow. You will be asked a new password and authenticated right away.

If you forgot your username and email, you will have to contact the support.

If your network account is connected to your LinkedIn account, you can use the "Log in with LinkedIn" button. You will need to authenticate on LinkedIn if your are not already. You may have to authorize the network (Sparkle Networks) to access your email address.

Language and time zone
---------------------

At the end of all pages you can see the actual language and time zone. Clicking it will allow you to change those preferences.

If the network allows many languages, you will be able to choose the one you prefer. Not choosing a language will use the network's preferred language.

You can always define a different time zone. This will affect all dates and times displayed on the network. You should choose the time zone with the city name the most close to you. For example, if I live in France, I will choose "(UTC+01:00) Brussels, Copenhagen, Madrid, Paris". If I live near New York City, I will choose "(UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)". Not choosing a time zone will use the network's preferred time zone.

Email notifications
---------------------

In order to keep up to date with your community, your network will send you emails updates. Go to your profile, your account and "Newsletters and notifications settings" to change your preferences.

### Email updates

You can subscribe and unsubscribe to many kinds of update. Contact requests, incoming private messages, comments on your publications, invitations, requests to join your groups, all publications, all comments, team timeline publications and comments... Just choose what you are interested into. It is better to keep enabled the updates you do not usually receive, they are useful.

### Newsletters

If you want to receive aggregated updates (less emails with more content), the newsletter is for you. You can choose between daily and weekly (Monday morning). The newsletter contains almost all activities of the previous day or week. If you go for the newsletter, you may want to disable "new publication" updates as they are redundant.
