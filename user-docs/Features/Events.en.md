
Events
==============

It is the best way to communicate about upcoming events and engage the members to join. Anyone can *create* an event on the network to promote it. Upcoming events are displayed in the newsletter and on the homepage to make sure everyone sees them before it is too late.

Creating an event
-------------------

In the events section, you will easily find buttons to create a new event.

The form will ask you information about the event you want to promote.

* Name
* Description ([free formatable text](TextFormat.en.md))
* Category
* Audience
* Start and end dates
* Information website
* Ticketing or reservation website
* Place
* Time zone

You may change the event details until the event has not happened. After the end date, you cannot change it.

You can learn more on [creating an event](Events/Create.en.md).


The event page
--------------------

The event page promotes your event. All the details from the create form are here.

Users can:

* contribute using the integrated [timeline](Timelines.en.md); 
* RSVP (indicate their participation)
    * *going* means the user has planned to come
    * *maybe* means the user may or may not come
    * *not going* means the user will not come 


The event members
---------------------

Based on the RSVPs, the event creator and network administrators can see the list of coming people.

If the event is or was public (audience), anonymous users may appear in the lists.

You can print a list of the users using your web browser. The keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+P` should do the trick.

There is also an export button to download a CSV file (open it in a spreadsheet editor).

Invite
---------------

You can invite users to join your event. They will receive an email and a [notification](Notifications.en.md).



Repeat the event
-----------------------

The event is occurring again? Save some time, use the repeat button in the past event. This will lead you to the create form with all fields copied from the past event. You only need to change the date!


Subscribe to the calendar
-------------------------------------------------

Some software programs and services allow you to subscribe to online calendars. You can synchronize the network's calendar in your personal calendar.

The main events page has a link "Export (iCal)". Make  right click on this button and choose Copy link location". The calendar URL is now copied, you can paste it in your event management software.

Do not share you calendar's URL! It may contain personal data (your participation in the network's events).
