            Returns profile information for a given user, including selected badges and mayorships.
            If the user is a friend, contact information, Facebook ID, and Twitter handle and the user's last checkin may also be present.
            In addition, the pings field will indicate whether checkins from this user will trigger a ping (notifications to mobile devices). This setting can be changed via setpings. Note that this setting is overriden if pings is false in settings (no pings will be sent, even if this user is set to true).

Note that although the venuehistory endpoint currently returns all of the user's data, we expect to return only the last 6 months, requiring callers to page backwards as needed. We may also remove the lastHereAt value. Additionally, for anomalous users, we'll cap out at 500 unique venues.

            https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/add
            Allows users to add a new venue.
            If this method returns an error, give the user the option to edit her inputs. The method may return an HTTP 409 error if the new venue looks like a duplicate of an existing venue. This response will include two useful values: candidateDuplicateVenues and ignoreDuplicatesKey. In this situation we recommend you try these two options: 1) use one of the candidateDuplicateVenues included in the response of the 409 error, or 2) ignore duplicates and force the addition of a new venue by resubmitting the same venue add request with two additional parameters: ignoreDuplicates set to true and ignoreDuplicatesKey set to the value from the earlier error response.
            In addition to this, give users the ability to say "never mind, check-in here anyway" and perform a manual ("venueless") checkin by specifying just the venue name
            All fields are optional, but one of either a valid address or a geolat/geolong pair must be provided. We recommend that developers provide a geolat/geolong pair in every case.
            Caller may also, optionally, pass in a category (primarycategoryid) to which you want this venue assigned. You can browse a full list of categories using the /categories method. On adding venue, we recommend that applications show the user this hierarchy and allow them to choose something suitable.

            Returns a list of venues near the current location, optionally matching the search term.
            To ensure the best possible results, pay attention to the intent parameter below. And if you're looking for "top" venues or recommended venues, use the explore endpoint instead. 
            If lat and long is provided, each venue includes a distance. If authenticated, the method will return venue metadata related to you and your friends. If you do not authenticate, you will not get this data.
            Note that most of the fields returned inside venue can be optional. The user may create a venue that has no address, city or state (the venue is created instead at the geolat/geolong specified). Your client should handle these conditions safely.
            You'll also notice a stats block that reveals some count data about the venue. herenow shows the number of people currently there (this value can be 0).

            Attaching a photo to a tip or a venue makes it visible to anybody, while attaching a photo to a checkin makes it visible only to the people who can see the checkin (the user's friends, unless the checkin has been sent to Twitter or Facebook.). 
            Multiple photos can be attached to a checkin or venue, but there can only be one photo per tip. 
            To avoid double-tweeting, if you are sending a checkin that will be immediately followed by a photo, do not set broadcast=twitter on the checkin, and just set it on the photo.
